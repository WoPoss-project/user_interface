            <p>The WoPoss team consists of three researchers funded by the SNSF. Thanks to the
                generosity of the University of Lausanne, we have been able to hire a number of
                students as assistants. They help us in the annotation task.</p>

                <p>I am SNSF assistant professor of historical linguistics at the University of Lausanne and
                    the PI of the WoPoss project.</p>
                <p>I am a historical linguist with a strong interest in semantics. My research and
                    expertise focus on the following areas:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the analysis of meaning –in particular modal meaning– from both a diachronic
                        and a synchronic perspective as well as the linguistic study of the
                        metaphor</li>
                    <li>the development of complementary methods which combine computational tools
                        and philological expertise and their application to ancient languages</li>
                    <li>the epistemological analysis of key concepts in the history of
                        linguistics</li>
                    <li>the linguistic analysis of ancient documents –inscriptions, manuscripts– in
                        their material context</li>
                    <li>the methods of teaching languages, in particular Classical languages</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>Helena Bermúdez Sabel holds a PhD in Medieval Studies from the Universidade
                        de Santiago de Compostela. Her doctoral research involved the development of
                        a digital edition model that enables the quantitative study of linguistic
                        variation through the automatic comparison of witnesses. An
                        implementation of the model was illustrated with a <a href="www.gl-pt.obdurodon.org" target="_blank">Galician-Portuguese
                        secular poetry corpus</a>.</p>
                    <p>Before UNIL, she worked at the Laboratorio de Innovación en Humanidades
                        Digitales (Madrid, Spain). She was a researcher at an ERC-funded project
                        focused on enabling the interoperability of poetic resources from European
                        traditions via linked open data. She also has a solid experience as
                        an instructor in Digital Humanities courses.</p>
                    <p>Helena is interested in data modeling and the formalization of annotation
                        schemes. She is proficient in XML technologies and linked data. Thanks to
                        her work in this project, she is exploring further programming
                        languages.</p>
                    <p>At WoPoss, she’s contributing to the annotation model. She supervises the
                        technical aspects of the annotation workflow, including the automation of
                        corpus pre-processing and post-processing. She is the developer of this
                        website, so <a href="mailto:wwwwoposs@unil.ch">let her know if you find
                            anything amiss</a>.</p>

                    <p>Paola Marongiu is a first year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of
                        Lausanne, Section des Sciences du Langage et de l’Information, and Assistant
                        in the FNS project WoPoss. Her PhD thesis focuses on the analysis of the
                        co-occurrence of modal markers in Latin, from both a quantitative and a
                        qualitative point of view. Her research interests include Theoretical
                        Linguistics, with a focus on Latin and Modality, Digital Humanities and
                        Computational Linguistics. More specifically, in her PhD project she will
                        employ computational methods and resources in order to investigate a
                        theoretical problem on multiple perspectives.</p>
                    <p>In 2018 she obtained a Master degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics
                        from the University of Pavia, with a thesis focused on the conversion of the
                        Index Thomisticus Treebank into the Universal Dependencies annotation style.</p>
                    <p>She has a Bachelor in Modern Studies, obtained from the University of Bologna
                        in 2016.</p>

                   <p>Maël Graa obtained a Bachelor of Arts in History and Latin and he decided to deepen his knowledge in these two fields during his post-graduate training.
                   He is currently pursuing a Master degree at the Université de Lausanne, with an additional specialization in Discourse and Public Communication Analysis. His Master Thesis concerns the Latin poetry by Théodore de Bèze</p>
