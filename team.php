    <p>The WoPoss team consists of three researchers funded by the SNSF. Thanks to the
        generosity of the University of Lausanne, we have been able to hire a number of
        students as assistants. They help us in the annotation task.</p>

        <p>I am SNSF assistant professor of historical linguistics at the University of Lausanne and
            the PI of the WoPoss project.</p>
        <p>I am a historical linguist with a strong interest in semantics. My research and
            expertise focus on the following areas:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>the analysis of meaning –in particular modal meaning– from both a diachronic
                and a synchronic perspective as well as the linguistic study of the
                metaphor
            </li>
            <li>the development of complementary methods which combine computational tools
                and philological expertise and their application to ancient languages
            </li>
            <li>the epistemological analysis of key concepts in the history of
                linguistics
            </li>
            <li>the linguistic analysis of ancient documents –inscriptions, manuscripts– in
                their material context
            </li>
            <li>the methods of teaching languages, in particular Classical languages</li>

            <p>Helena Bermúdez Sabel holds a PhD in Medieval Studies from the Universidade
                de Santiago de Compostela. Her doctoral research involved the development of
                a digital edition model that enables the quantitative study of linguistic
                variation through the automatic comparison of witnesses. An
                implementation of the model was illustrated with a <a href="www.gl-pt.obdurodon.org" target="_blank">Galician-Portuguese
                    secular poetry corpus</a>.</p>
            <p>Before UNIL, she worked at the Laboratorio de Innovación en Humanidades
                Digitales (Madrid, Spain). She was a researcher at an ERC-funded project
                focused on enabling the interoperability of poetic resources from European
                traditions via linked open data. She also has a solid experience as
                an instructor in Digital Humanities courses.</p>
            <p>Helena is interested in data modeling and the formalization of annotation
                schemes. She is proficient in XML technologies and linked data. Thanks to
                her work in this project, she is exploring further programming
                languages.</p>
            <p>At WoPoss, she’s contributing to the annotation model. She supervises the
                technical aspects of the annotation workflow, including the automation of
                corpus pre-processing and post-processing. She is the developer of this
                website, so <a href="mailto:wwwwoposs@unil.ch">let her know if you find
                    anything amiss</a>.</p>

            <p>Paola Marongiu is a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of
                Lausanne, Section des Sciences du Langage et de l’Information, and Assistant
                in the FNS project WoPoss. Her PhD thesis focuses on the analysis of the
                co-occurrence of modal markers in Latin, from both a quantitative and a
                qualitative point of view. Her research interests include Theoretical
                Linguistics, with a focus on Latin and Modality, Digital Humanities and
                Computational Linguistics. More specifically, in her PhD project she will
                employ computational methods and resources in order to investigate a
                theoretical problem on multiple perspectives.</p>
            <p>In 2018 she obtained a Master degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics
                from the University of Pavia, with a thesis focused on the conversion of the
                Index Thomisticus Treebank into the Universal Dependencies annotation style.</p>
            <p>She has a Bachelor in Modern Studies, obtained from the University of Bologna
                in 2016.</p>

            <p>Maël Graa obtained a Bachelor of Arts in History and Latin and he decided to deepen his knowledge in
                these two fields during his post-graduate training.
                He is currently pursuing a Master degree at the Université de Lausanne, with an additional
                specialization in Discourse and Public Communication Analysis. His Master Thesis concerns the Latin

            <p>Séverine Reymond obtained her Bachelor in Music at the Haute Ecole de Musique de
                Lausanne. Due to her keen interest in interdisciplinarity and having in mind broadening her
                horizons, she chose to complete her BA in Letters, specializing in Latin and Theology. Her curiosity for
                linguistics and the opportunity to read complete Latin works have motivated her to be part of this
                project. She focuses her readings on Christian texts, thereby deepening her knowledge of
                the history and theology of ancient Christianity.</p>

                specific than his class assignments. The task at hand forced him to deepen his knowledge in Data-Driven
                Documents (D3) as well as web programming in general. Confronting the expectations of years of studying
                and the reality of an actual development project is likely the most positive takeaway of his whole

Kevin's main interests within the Classics lie in Philology. His interest in Ancient Greek and the Latin language as well as their literature is the main reason why he decided to join the project
                <em>Planude traducteur d’Ovide</em> which gives him the opportunity to read a parallel corpus in Greek and Latin.</p>

                centered on Latin language and literature and (historical) linguistics.
                He wants to develop and acquire new abilities and skills in the fields he is studying. His main goal is
                to better understand ancient cultures, including their languages, in order to better
                understand our current world. For all those reasons, he is taking part and contributing to this

                <h3>In his words:</h3>
                <p>During my time working with the WoPoss team, I had the opportunity to learn more about the (complex)
                    latin syntactic functions and about a whole new field of knowledge that is really underestimated. It
                    forced me to try to think like an ancient author, more so since I worked with Plautus which already
                    is a
                    really complex “character” on its own. I learned a lot, and with this message I thank the WoPoss
                    team
                    for their help and for their kindness, welcoming me in this adventure.</p></div>
