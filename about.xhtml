        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Research about the diachrony of modality has been lively since the 1980s (Ziegeler
            2016). The investigation conducted on modal verbs in the Germanic languages, especially
            English, has shown beyond any doubt that languages with a good amount of available
            written history are fundamental in reconstructing the diachronic pathways of modality
            and support the panchronic approach adopted for less well-documented or less studied
            languages (e.g. Bybee - Perkins - Pagliuca 1994). Nevertheless, diachronic research
            needs to open to other lexical markers (cf. e.g. Nuyts 2001, Van linden 2012) as well as
            to other possible benchmarks of comparison by taking advantage of well-documented
            languages. The main aim of this project is to perform the first large- scope analysis of
            modalisation paths on the extra-long period in Latin, a language whose documented
            history spans over more than two millennia and offers a wide-ranging variety of written
            sources.</p>
        <p>In contrast with mainstream research on lexical markers expressing modality, my project
            focuses not only on verbs (e.g. possum ‘have power, be able’) but also on adjectives
            (e.g. the adjectives in -bilis), nouns (e.g. necessitas ‘unavoidableness’) and adverbs
            (e.g. sentence adverbs such as quidem ‘undoubtedly’), offering a comprehensive approach
            to the Latin lexical modal system 3 . Since the diachronic study of modality is an
            emerging field of contemporary linguistic research, the absence of monograph-length
            studies on the evolution of the Latin lexical modal system and the inadequacy of most
            Latin dictionaries in tracing the polysemy of modal forms are by no way surprising. The
            only feasible way to reconstruct modal pathways and competition mechanisms among modal
            forms in the history of Latin is therefore to adopt a corpus-based approach. In order to
            gain a broad overview of the evolution of modality based on a thorough description of
            modal readings and uses at the synchronic level, a corpus of texts chosen according to
            sociolinguistic criteria is mandatory.</p>
