                <em>A world of possibilities. Modal pathways on the extra-long period of time: the
                    diachrony of modality in the Latin language</em> (WoPoss) aims at reconstructing
                the evolution of modal meanings from the prehistory of the Latin language up to the
                7th century CE. The WoPoss team is working on the linguistic annotation of a
                selection of modal markers in a diachronic corpus of Latin literary and documentary
                texts. As annotation progresses, data will be made available during the project
                lifespan (February 2019–January 2023). </p>
